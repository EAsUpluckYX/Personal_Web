Hello, this is Sheldon. I'm currently a Bachelor of Information student at the University of Toronto. My academic journey began at the University of Waterloo where I pursued studies in Mathematics. In my sophomore year, I decided to transfer to UofT's iSchool, aligning my path with my growing interest in information studies.

I’m an explorer, dreamer, developer, thinker, and more. My curiosity, creativity, and diligence guided every project I’ve taken on. I use this space to showcase my current journey in Ischool, to detail upcoming plans, and to make my presence felt in the world. I’m constantly changing and evolving, and I am excited to share every step of my journey with you.
